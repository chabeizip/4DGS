# 4DGS

Explorations based on the official implementation of *[4D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08528)*, published in CVPR 2024.

Installation and training see the official implementation.   

## C
1. Initialize 3D Gaussians.  
2. Check t.  
3. Modify multi-head gaussian deformation decoder.  
4. Check training setup.
